About the data folder
================================

*see also [contributing.md](https://github.com/redaktor/nlp_compromise/blob/master/contributing.md).*

**The language specific folders are autogenerated by grunt!**<br>
:pencil: **Contribute, change and document only the files beginning with 'dictionary'.**<br>
It's easy.


:lock_with_ink_pen: :exclamation:Never touch any file in the language folders (e.g. 'en', 'de')
